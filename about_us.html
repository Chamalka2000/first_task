        <br>
        <p> As the EU has no connection with the system Busses, this job is done by BIU. BIU and EU are connected with an internal bus. BIU connects EU with the memory or I/O circuits. It is responsible for transmitting data, addresses and control signal on the busses.
Registers: BIU has 4 segment busses, CS, DS, SS, ES. These all 4 segment registers hold the addresses of instructions and data in memory. These values are used by the processor to access memory locations. It also contains 1 pointer register IP. IP contains the address of the next instruction to executed by the EU.
Instruction Queue: BIU also contain an instruction queue. When the EU executes instructions, the BIU gets up to 6 bytes of the next instruction and stores them in the instruction queue and this process is called instruction prefetch. This is a process to speed up the processor. A subtle advantage of instruction queue is that, as next several instructions are usually in the queue, the BIU can access memory at a somewhat "leisurely" pace. This means that slow-memory parts can be used without affecting overall system performance.
